## Plan

Learn elixir by solving the problems in this book. I will not implement the
"challenges" section for now. Might go back and finish it in the future.

## Organization

Each exercise will have its own directory including a README to document
the problem and related details.

### Elixir

All solutions were written with Elixir 1.3.
